        <h1>Hx</h1>
        <p>Every player’s character has Hx, history, with every other player’s
            character. Your Hx with someone says how well you know them. It’s based
            on specific moments or episodes in your shared past. Your Hx with them,
            written on your character sheet, says how well you know them; theirs with
            you, on their sheet, says how well they know you.</p>
            <p>It doesn’t say how long
            you’ve known them, how much you like them, how positive your history
            together has been, or anything else necessarily, just how well you get them.
            If your Hx with somebody is negative, that means that you really don’t
            know them and can’t predict what they’ll do. Thus, you can’t effectively
            help them OR screw them over. <b>Hx is asymmetrical</b>—My character might
            know yours Hx+2, but yours might know mine Hx-1, or whatever</p>
        <h2>Marking Hx</h2>
        <p><b>At the end of every session,</b> choose a character who knows you
            better than they used to. If there’s more than one, choose one at your
            whim. Tell that player to add +1 to their Hx with you on their sheet.
            If this brings them to Hx+4, they reset to Hx+1 (and therefore mark
            experience).</p><p>If no one knows you better, choose a character who
            doesn’t know you as well as they thought, or choose any character at
            your whim. Tell that player to take -1 to their Hx with you on their
            sheet. If this brings them to Hx -3, they reset to Hx=0 (and therefore
            mark experience).</p>
